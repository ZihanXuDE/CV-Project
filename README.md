# CV-Project: Tour Into the Picture
This is a CV project from the Computer Vision course at TUM. The theme of this project is Tour Into the Picture (TIP).

I will show you here the reconstructed 3D models of 2D images for poster session (you can open it with MATLAB). Explanation of principles and operation will be given at the poster session.

Owing to time constraints, I will give the other details later.
