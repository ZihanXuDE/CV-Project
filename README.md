# CV-Project: Tour Into the Picture
This is a CV project from the Computer Vision course at TUM. The theme of this project is Tour Into the Picture (TIP).

You can download the fig-data to get the reconstructed 3D models from 2D images (you can open it with MATLAB). Explanation of principles and operation will be given at the poster session.

I'll also show you some result images below for reference.

Task 1: Metro Station
This picture show a beautiful metro station, which has a arch roof and some foreground objects such as chandeliers and passengers. Here, you can see some pictures that were taken at different viewpoints in the reconstructed space.

Task 2: Hongkong
This picture shows a street scene of Hongkong. There are many foreground objects such as buses and trams. Here, you can see some pictures that were taken at different viewpoints in the reconstructed space.

Task 3: Oil Painting
This is not a real picture but an oil painting, nevertheless, my program has successfully reconstructed its 3D space with some foreground objects. You can just take a look at the result via oil-painting.fig because it is a reletive simple image.

Task 4: Simple Room
This is an oil painting. You can take a look at the result via simple-room.fig.

Owing to time constraints, I will give the other details later.
